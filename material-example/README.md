# material-example
This repository has all of the example applications for https://kubernetes-hy.github.io

If you want to make changes to the applications feel free to make a PR. The PR must keep the application working as an example application, but any changes otherwise are welcome.

Github Actions will automatically publish any changes to a specific application. This will require rewriting course material (and yamls within this repository) to reflect the changed image tag.
