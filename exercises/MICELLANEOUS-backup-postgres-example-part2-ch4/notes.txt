First run the stateful set and when its up, you may try backing it up with the other `backup-job`.

```bash
ka ./manifest/statefulset.yaml
# wait til our postgres container is up made by the stateful set...

# when ready, use below job to backup:
ka ./manifest/backup-job.yaml


### verify by
kubectl get jobs
kc logs -f backup--<TAB-TO-AUTOCOMPLETE-NAME>


### also
kc get pod
# Output:
# NAME                  READY   STATUS      RESTARTS       AGE
