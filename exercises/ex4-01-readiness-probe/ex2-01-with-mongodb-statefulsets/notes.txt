# Readme

Replicating desired behaviour required in ex-4-01 ?

```bash
ka pingpong/manifests/deploy.yaml ^C
ka log-output/manifests/


# Now you may check the result from `kcwatch` and you would notice that all pods are up but none of them are ready coz the `readinessProbe` check for both pingpong and ex-1-01 
(logouput) apps are failing!

# NOW to get these pods up, you just need to up our database, by
ka pingpong/manifests/mongo-statefulset.yaml

# and you'll notice that everything woul be ready now and fuctionally work as well!!
```
