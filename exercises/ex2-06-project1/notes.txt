# What am i doing?

I created a configmap.yaml file and linked it to deployment.yaml file.
- `configmap.yaml` file includes my environemnt values.
- I  am not mounting my env file to volume at all.

# Consider your deployment is up.

Now if you change values in environment varaiables in `configmap.yaml`, then first you need to apply new `configmap.yaml` file via:

```
kc apply -f manifests/configmap.yaml
# OR SIMPLY kc apply -f manifests/ WOULD WORK SAME!

# then you need to delete the pod:
kc delete po project1-dep-<TAB>

# NOW you have the latest variables which you just set in `configmap.yaml` file.
```
